Greetings,

This are my answer regarding on the Versa Asia Online Case Study for Developer Internship opportunities. 

Programming Language used : JAVA (Netbeans IDE 8.2)

I've attached the JAVA file and together with the JSON output file on the Big Bang Challenge. So here's the detailed explanation on my work solving this Big Bang Challenge.

1) Importing the libraries to be use which are Java I/O package to write on the output file, and Org JSON, to create the object of JSON
2) I declared the variable of an array in JSON type
3) I start the initiation of the iteration (100 Iteration)
4) Inside the loop, there's three conditional to check on the divisbile by 3 and 5, divisible by 3, and divisible by 5
5) If it divisible by 3 and 5, the output "BIG BANG" will be added into the array, if it divisible by 3, the output "BIG" will be added into the array, and if it divisible by 5, the output "BANG" will be added into the array, respectively.
6) If none of the conditional met, the current number of iteration will be added into the array
7) After the iteration finished, a JSON object have been created to save the output into the object
8) And the object will be saved into "output.json" using FileWriter libraries.
9) Both creation of JSON object and I/O has their exception of catch.

After all this is a good challenge and experience for me to be taken on. Indeed, its a great experience to be part of the candidates on taking this challenge. After all, thank you for giving me out the opportunity on going through the Internship placement process. Thanks a bunch !
